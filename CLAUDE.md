# Memory

Everytime you do perform implementations - I want you to write it down to the following folders:

- specs/<data in format: DD-MM-YY->-<some description of the implementation>/spec.md <-- here you add the details of the implementation
- specs/<data in format: DD-MM-YY->-<some description of the implementation>/tasks.md <-- here you add the details of the each task/task group

If you read any file and texts, titles or descriptions are in portuguese-brazilian,
you can translate them to english when coding the implementation that will use the data extract from the file(s) you read.
